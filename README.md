Last Resistance
===============
This is an entirely new gamemode for Natural Selection 2.  
The basic idea is:

***
Every player starts as marine, except one guy that is going alien (random slection)  
All marines are fighting as a team.  
The marine weapons are placed all around the map.  
If the alien kill a marine, he will mutate to an alien, until all marines are killed and mutated to an alien.  
**Goal**: Marines get points per second they survived as marine, the one with highest score wins  
***
